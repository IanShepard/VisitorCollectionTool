Making plans for second itteration:
For this next iteration, we are planning to incorporate EventBrite API and start work on the manager dashboard.
With the API we will be calling the event name and the attendeeâ€™s information to the csv.
The manager dashboard would download csv file, create new csv file,  update csv file, and be able to add new events.
