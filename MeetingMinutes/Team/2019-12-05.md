## Things Clarified

need clarified:

Hey Ted, since we need an attendance list in our system, how do you know who is attending your events? We know that Eventbrite is one way, but I'm told that accounts for only half of your events. Do you have your own sign-up system? Do you have events where you don't have an expected attendance list?
