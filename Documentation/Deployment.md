# Deployment Documentation

## Setting up the server

Visitor Collection Tools runs on an Apache server. If you already have an Apache server running simply copy all of the extracted files into your publicly visible server folder.

If you do not have a server or want to start a new one, then you will need to use XAMPP. [Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and install XAMPP onto the server device. It is suggested to use the default install location which is the root folder in your C drive. htdocs is a folder which can run the code and make it available on the network. 

## Install and updates

Download the latest version of [Visitor Collection Tool]() and extract the zip file. Copy all of the extracted files into ..\xampp\htdocs. If you are updating to a newer version, then overwrite all of the previous files.

## Starting the server

Run xampp-control.exe in ..\xampp. Once running, click the start button for Apache. The server is now running and can be accessed through localhost.

## Stoping the server

Go to the XAMPP control panel and click stop for Apache. The server is no longer running and is not accessible.
