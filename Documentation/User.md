# User Manual

## The Manager page

Go to the [manager dashboard](localhost/ui/manager.php). Here you can see events, add new events, and download the event files. You may also navigate to the setup page where an event can be staged. 

## Manger setting event for attendees to check in

Browse to [localhost](localhost). This is the setup page. Select an event from the drop-down list that you want to stage. Saging an event will select the event that attendees are checking in to. Submit the event. The device is now ready to check in attendees for that event. This event will be staged until you return to the setup page. You do not need to restage the event between checking in or registering attendees.

## A registered attendee checking in to the event

The Check In page is the main access point for the attendee. If the attendee has preregistered then the attendee shall enter their first and last name into the field, then click submit. If there is a match in the expected attendee list, then a table shows below; otherwise the system will show an alert notifying the attendee that "Name does not exist or you are already checked in!" and allows the attendee to re-enter their name. If there is a match, the attendee chooses "This is me" on the row that matches their name and email. An alert will show confirming that the attendee has succesfully signed in. This action checks in the attendee.

## Registering a walk-in attendee

From the Check In page, click Register. The attendee shall enter the appropriate information in each field. Email must be in a valid email format. Then click Submit. You are now added to the attendee list. You may now check in as normal. You may also return to the check in page by clicking the Back button.
