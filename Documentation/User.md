#User Manual

It is expected that a manager has already opened the Check In page.

## Checking in a registered attendee to the event

The Check In page is the main access point for the attendee. If the attendee has preregistered then the attendee shall enter their first and last name into the field, then click submit. If the entered name matches one or more in the expected attendee list, then a table shows below; otherwise the system will show an alert notifying the attendee that "Name does not exist or you are already checked in!" and allows the attendee to re-enter their name. If there is a match, the attendee chooses "This is me" on the row that matches their name and email. An alert will show confirming that the attendee has succesfully signed in. This action checks in the attendee.

## Register a walk-in

From the Check In page, click Register. The attendee shall enter the appropriate information in each field. Email must be in a valid email format. Then click Submit. You may also return to the Check In page by clicking the Back button.
